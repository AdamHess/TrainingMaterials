* How to configure a [View Rendering](http://www.matthewdresser.com/sitecore/carousel-sitecore-mvc-(part-1-view-renderings)), a [Controller Rendering](http://www.matthewdresser.com/sitecore/carousel-sitecore-mvc-(part-2-controller-renderings)) and an [Item Rendering](http://www.matthewdresser.com/sitecore/carousel-sitecore-mvc-(part-3-item-renderings))
* [Glass Mapper Tutorials](https://web.archive.org/web/20160327074206/http://glass.lu/Mapper/Sc/Tutorials) - The folks who make Glass Mapper took down the tutorial so more users will use their paid training. The [Glass Mapper](https://github.com/mikeedwards83/Glass.Mapper) repo isn't much help either.
