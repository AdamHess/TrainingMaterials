# Sitecore Training and Resources

* How to configure a [View Rendering](http://www.matthewdresser.com/sitecore/carousel-sitecore-mvc-(part-1-view-renderings)), a [Controller Rendering](http://www.matthewdresser.com/sitecore/carousel-sitecore-mvc-(part-2-controller-renderings)) and an [Item Rendering](http://www.matthewdresser.com/sitecore/carousel-sitecore-mvc-(part-3-item-renderings))
* [Glass Mapper Tutorials](https://web.archive.org/web/20160327074206/http://glass.lu/Mapper/Sc/Tutorials) - The folks who make Glass Mapper took down the tutorial so more users will use their paid training. The [Glass Mapper](https://github.com/mikeedwards83/Glass.Mapper) repo isn't much help either. 
* [Sitecore Slack Join Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bAVDgP5-FhFh8ohPchHtifq-rz7EBkuPojAzdEofJyo/viewform?edit_requested=true)
* [Working with the Search Api](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LDJC3M36gA) - clear example of walking through the search API and how to use it with Glass Mapper.
