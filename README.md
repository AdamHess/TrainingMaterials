# Intro
A few years ago I put together a stupendously long email for all the resources I could think of, to getting junior developers up to speed.
I kept finding myself going back to that same email and sending it to new developers with ocassional updates. 

Many of these resources are intended as quick reads, viewing and solid foundational information for more senior devs. 

Many resources are free, however, Pluralsight and O'Reilly Online accounts are heavily referenced, and recommended. These paid resources are well worth their cost.
